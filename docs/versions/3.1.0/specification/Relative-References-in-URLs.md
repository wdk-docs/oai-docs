# <a name="relativeReferencesURL"></a>Relative References in URLs

Unless specified otherwise, all properties that are URLs MAY be relative references as defined by [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.2).
Unless specified otherwise, relative references are resolved using the URLs defined in the [`Server Object`](#serverObject) as a Base URL. Note that these themselves MAY be relative to the referring document.

# 鉴别器对象

当请求主体或响应有效载荷可能是多个不同模式中的一个时，可以使用`鉴别器`对象来帮助序列化、反序列化和验证。鉴别器是模式中的一个特定对象，用于根据与之相关的值向文档的消费者通知替代模式。

使用鉴别器时，将不考虑 _inline_ schemas。

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name                                  |          Type           | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | :---------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <a name="propertyName"></a>propertyName     |        `string`         | **REQUIRED**. The name of the property in the payload that will hold the discriminator value. |
| <a name="discriminatorMapping"></a> mapping | Map[`string`, `string`] | An object to hold mappings between payload values and schema names or references.             |

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](#specificationExtensions).

The discriminator object is legal only when using one of the composite keywords `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`.

In OAS 3.0, a response payload MAY be described to be exactly one of any number of types:

```yaml
MyResponseType:
  oneOf:
    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Cat"
    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Dog"
    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Lizard"
```

which means the payload _MUST_, by validation, match exactly one of the schemas described by `Cat`, `Dog`, or `Lizard`. In this case, a discriminator MAY act as a "hint" to shortcut validation and selection of the matching schema which may be a costly operation, depending on the complexity of the schema. We can then describe exactly which field tells us which schema to use:

```yaml
MyResponseType:
  oneOf:
    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Cat"
    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Dog"
    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Lizard"
  discriminator:
    propertyName: petType
```

The expectation now is that a property with name `petType` _MUST_ be present in the response payload, and the value will correspond to the name of a schema defined in the OAS document. Thus the response payload:

```json
{
  "id": 12345,
  "petType": "Cat"
}
```

Will indicate that the `Cat` schema be used in conjunction with this payload.

In scenarios where the value of the discriminator field does not match the schema name or implicit mapping is not possible, an optional `mapping` definition MAY be used:

```yaml
MyResponseType:
  oneOf:
    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Cat"
    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Dog"
    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Lizard"
    - $ref: "https://gigantic-server.com/schemas/Monster/schema.json"
  discriminator:
    propertyName: petType
    mapping:
      dog: "#/components/schemas/Dog"
      monster: "https://gigantic-server.com/schemas/Monster/schema.json"
```

Here the discriminator _value_ of `dog` will map to the schema `#/components/schemas/Dog`, rather than the default (implicit) value of `Dog`. If the discriminator _value_ does not match an implicit or explicit mapping, no schema can be determined and validation SHOULD fail. Mapping keys MUST be string values, but tooling MAY convert response values to strings for comparison.

When used in conjunction with the `anyOf` construct, the use of the discriminator can avoid ambiguity where multiple schemas may satisfy a single payload.

In both the `oneOf` and `anyOf` use cases, all possible schemas MUST be listed explicitly. To avoid redundancy, the discriminator MAY be added to a parent schema definition, and all schemas comprising the parent schema in an `allOf` construct may be used as an alternate schema.

For example:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      required:
        - petType
      properties:
        petType:
          type: string
      discriminator:
        propertyName: petType
        mapping:
          dog: Dog
    Cat:
      allOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pet"
        - type: object
          # all other properties specific to a `Cat`
          properties:
            name:
              type: string
    Dog:
      allOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pet"
        - type: object
          # all other properties specific to a `Dog`
          properties:
            bark:
              type: string
    Lizard:
      allOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pet"
        - type: object
          # all other properties specific to a `Lizard`
          properties:
            lovesRocks:
              type: boolean
```

a payload like this:

```json
{
  "petType": "Cat",
  "name": "misty"
}
```

will indicate that the `Cat` schema be used. Likewise this schema:

```json
{
  "petType": "dog",
  "bark": "soft"
}
```

will map to `Dog` because of the definition in the `mapping` element.
